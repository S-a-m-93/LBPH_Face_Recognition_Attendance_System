# LBPH_Face_Recognition_Attendance_System# Face Recognition using LBPH, Python, and MySQL

This project is a basic implementation of face recognition using LBPH algorithm, implemented in Python with OpenCV library, and MySQL database for storing user data.

## Features

- Detects faces using LBPH algorithm.
- Stores user data (name, roll number) in a MySQL database.
- Captures and stores images of users for training the recognition model.
- Marks attendance with timestamps in the database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MySQL Connector
- MySQL Database Server
